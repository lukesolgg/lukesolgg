How did I get into development?


learnt in school when 14 - python(semi), learnt all about hardware & computers got really interested (computer science) 

learn html & css when I was 15/16  building websites etc. for fun

16/17 learnt javascript and was still in school doing exams not focused as much on coding then

when I turned 18 I purchased Full stack engineer course on codeacademy and really got learning things like git, react, redux, node, nextjs, tailwind, yarn.

in the past 6/7 months I have been into NFTs thru a few alpha groups & then around january/february I left my job to focus full time on becoming a developer, as of recently I have been focused on learning solana & anchor & rust
